# TYPHOON-2
ADSB &amp; ATC Interceptor for SIGINT (Signals Intelligence)&amp; IMINT (Imagery Intelligence) Missions.

Typhoon 2 is software that allows the interception of signals using an open-source ADSB (Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast) decoder and transcribes them onto an interactive map. 
It also intercepts ATC (Air-Traffic-Control) communications, also sourced openly, and displays their locations on an interactive map.

The interactive map supports various analysis methods, such as image overlay, and also provides the ability to draw geometric shapes or make distance measurements and more.

# SUPERPOSE INVESTIGATION üîç

The overlay of maps allows for precise analysis of areas and displays the map in geographical mode, adding location information on top. (Sensitive zones are not necessarily blurred on the maps)

this mode provides very precise information (mountain names, altitude, airports, roads, harbours, buildings) and more..
