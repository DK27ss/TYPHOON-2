# TYPHOON-2
ADSB &amp; ATC Interceptor for SIGINT (Signals Intelligence)&amp; IMINT (Imagery Intelligence) Missions.

Typhoon 2 is software that allows the interception of signals using an open-source ADSB (Automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast) decoder and transcribes them onto an interactive map. 
It also intercepts ATC (Air-Traffic-Control) communications, also sourced openly, and displays their locations on an interactive map.

The interactive map supports various analysis methods, such as image overlay, and also provides the ability to draw geometric shapes or make distance measurements and more.
